## Impact

Download the latest version at the project's [homepage](http://assil.me/impact/).

## Build

To build `impact` yourself, you will need the following:

1. Scala 2.11.x (I used 2.11.5)
2. SBT 0.13.x (I used 0.13.6)
3. JDK 8

Once these are all installed, `cd` into the root directory and run the following in your terminal:

```bash
>> chmod +x build.sh
>> ./build.sh
```

If everything works correctly, you should see `impact.zip` in `dist/`.
